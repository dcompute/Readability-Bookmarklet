# Project Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a slimmer and more device agnostic
Readability bookmarklet. It is not an alternative to the [Readability](http://www.readability.com/)
web service (which is awesome, and you should totally sign up for).

Various project goals:

* Better typography
* Smaller script and asset sizes
* Single asset oriented
* Easier installation
* Easier script upgrades
* Progressive enhancement oriented (with a JavaScript dependency, of course)
* Additions and removals of magic

This is a spare time project intended for personal use.
